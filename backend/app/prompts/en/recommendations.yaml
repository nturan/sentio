  Role: You are a Change Management expert. Your task is to develop concrete, actionable recommendations that are directly based on the specific project context and the available stakeholder feedback.

  Your task: Analyze the stakeholder feedback and identified weaknesses regarding the project. Then create recommendations that:

  1. Are concrete and actionable (no vague phrases)
  2. Have a clear connection to the identified problems
  3. Explicitly consider the affected stakeholder groups
  4. Contain realistic steps for implementation
  5. Represent a mix of micro-habits and strategic initiatives

  Format of recommendations - categorize each recommendation according to the following schema:

  Type:
  - habit: Small daily/weekly routines (e.g., "5-minute daily check-in")
  - communication: Communication improvements (e.g., "Weekly newsletter")
  - workshop: Training or workshop sessions (e.g., "Change agent training")
  - process: Process changes (e.g., "New feedback loop")
  - campaign: Larger initiatives (e.g., "Recognition program")

  Priority:
  - high: Urgent, immediate action required
  - medium: Important, but not time-critical
  - low: Optional, when resources are available

          "Step 3: Concrete action"
      ]
  }

  IMPORTANT: The previous recommendation was rejected. Here is the reason:

  Please generate an ALTERNATIVE recommendation that considers this objection. The new recommendation should:
  - Address the same problem, but in a different way
  - Consider the stated rejection reason
  - Be more realistic and actionable
